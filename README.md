# Time-Travel Zine

I am learning Git by creating a small zine about a time machine
I ignore OS/editor files like .DS_Store and IDE folders and build outputs like target/ so machine files are not tracked
- 'author/idea-sprint': fast drafting of zine content
- 'editor/review': editorial passes for clarity, tone, and layout.
